Features I can work on

- Clicking the link and going to the specific website
- Improve performance in the background
- Have an overall timer and breakdown of sites

-----
UI implementation:
-increase the padding below the pause and clear button, change how the buttons look, modernize implementation
- play around with the colors see what works



Updates to implement:

- No need to handle the display update in the background no? I can change that messaging altogether and just track it in the frontend
- Improve the UI experience of saving the sessions
